# gameplay
[ ] weapons:
  [ ] shield 
    - could be made as projectile that is also mountable so it follows player?
    - should not destroy projectiles but bounce them off!
  [ ] shotgun
    - weapon with ammo of which the projectiles go sideways.
  [ ] booster
    - extra power while pressing x, could be a weapon with auto-fire and projectiles with small lifespam? WE can add recoil to all weapons so this would be how the booster works, lots of recoil.
  [ ] wrecking ball
   - wrecking ball connected to back of car! Important that it swings naturally and has huge impuls on other cars upon hit.
  [ ] ammo multiplier?
   - when picked up, your current ammo is multiplied by 3 or something.
[ ] abilities:
  [X] bash sideways (and forward/backwards ?)
    - ability to dash sideways with maybe the right stick of the controller, to bash other players of the cliff and make sharper turns.
  [ ] jump? not sure about this one.
